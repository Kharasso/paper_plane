## Project Description
'Paper Planes' is a sensor-based visualization-sonification generator. It analyzes the fly path of a paper plane captured either through a realtime webcam or  a pre-recorded video, interprets the time series of the paper plane's position, velocity and acceleration along different directions and renders these parameters into varying sound and color-coded visualizations. It is an engaging and interative device where the users can experiment on making paper planes of different shapes to test out their varied fly paths and the consequent visual and sound effects generated from the program.


## Software
